# Library-Management-System

Introduction

The project titled "Library Management System" is a library management software for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library. The project is developed in java swing, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding a new book, searching books based on their book title,category, author,issue book to users and list books which are to be returned for the current date. It is a GUI application written for 64-bit Windows operating systems, designed to help users maintain and organize libraries. Our software is easy to use for both beginners and advanced users. It features a familiar and well thought-out, an attractive user interface.
The software Library Management System has four main modules.
1.Insertion to Database Module- User friendly input screen
2.Extracting from Database Module- Attractive Output screen
3.Report generation Module- Borrowed book list and available book list
4.Search facility system- Search for books
All these modules are able to help librarians to manage the library with more convenience and in a more efficient way as compared to library systems which are not computerized.

Background study

Library Management System is an application which refers to library systems which are generally small or medium in size. It is used by librarians to manage the library using a computerized system where he/she can record various transactions like issue of books, return of books and addition of new books. Books maintenance is also included in this system which would keep track of the users using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library contains. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record which generally happens when a non computerized system is used. In addition, the report module is also included in the Library Management System. A student can add a book by providing the following information, BookID, Book Name, Publisher name, Price and Published Year. We can view book details. A book can be issued to a student by first selecting a book from a list of books and then selecting the student from the list of complete search results. Also the date of issue is saved while issuing and return date is calculated.
Our system has the following advantages.

● User friendly interface

● Fast access to database

● Less error

● More storage capacity

● Search facility

● Look and feel environment

● Quick transaction

All the manual difficulties in managing the library have been rectified by implementing computerization. A review of literature reveals that a computerized library management system will:

● Help to improve the library service

● Help the librarians with management information

● Increase the rate at which tasks are completed accurately

Objective/ Vision
Our main objective for developing this system is to manage books in the library in an efficient manner. Librarian can add/view books, issue, view issued books and return books through this system.

Users of the System

● Librarian

Functional Requirements

Librarian
1. Can login
2. Can add/view student details
3. Can add/view book details
4. Issue books
5. Can view issued books
6. Return Books
7. Can view returned books
8. Can logout

Non-functional Requirements

● Performance -The system should be able to run in an efficient manner

● Efficiency - The efficiency of the system depends on how it is designed in a user-friendly manner.

● Security - Strictly it wouldn't allow any unauthorized users without login credentials.

Methodology

We used a rapid application development model to develop our system. There are no predefined requirements but we have to develop in a short time. So we did a prototype and showed it to the client and changed the things according to the feedback. So rapid application development model is suitable for this project.

● Requirement Gathering

● Prototype

● Implementation

● Testing

● Maintenance and evaluation

The library management system needs to be computerized to reduce human errors and to increaseefficiency. The proposed library management system in this proposal computerized managementsystem developed to maintain all the daily work of the library. Library management system design to store old information about books. The main focus of this project is to lessen human effort and encourage efficient record keeping.
